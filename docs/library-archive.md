# Library archive format, version 2

A library, or an exported Performance, is one archive file
([RFC 0021](rfcs/0021-sounds-performances-and-library.md#libraries)): a zip holding

| Entry | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `library.json` | The manifest (below) |
| `Performances/<folder>/` | Each Performance as the library keeps it: `performance.json` ([format](performance-format.md)) and `nodes/` |
| `Sounds/<folder>/` | Each Sound the same way, `sound.json` and `nodes/` |
| `Assets/<first 16 hex digits of the SHA-256>/<file>` | Each sample the items' plugins use, once |
| `Plugins/<format>/<id>@<version>/<platform>/<bundle>` | Each plugin build the items use ([RFC 0006](rfcs/0006-packages-and-portability.md)), a file or a bundle folder as installed; characters other than letters, digits, `.`, `-`, `@` and `_` in the ID and version are `_` |

The manifest:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `format`, `version` | Exactly `oscairn.library` and integer `2` |
| `id` | The library's ID: its folder's name when installed as a library, and what imported copies record as their `origin` |
| `name` | Its name |
| `kind` | `library`, `performance` for an exported Performance or `sound` for an exported Sound (its ID and name are that item's) |
| `items` | Each item's `kind` (`performance` or `sound`), `id`, `name` and `path`, its folder in the archive |
| `plugins` | Each plugin's `format`, `id`, `version`, `name` and `builds`: each build's `platform` (such as `macos-arm64` or `linux-arm64`), `path` in the archive and `sha256`, its digest as a [Performance's lock](performance-format.md) gives it |
| `files` | Every other entry's SHA-256, by its path |

An export holds the Performance, the library Sound of each part that is still that Sound (the
part unedited since it was loaded or saved, and the library holding that revision), and with
**edited Sounds**, the Sound of each part edited since, as the library has it. Every sample their
plugins list goes in once, by its hash. Each plugin they use goes in with every build there is:
this device's from its `pathHint` while that build still has the document's locked digest, else
from the plugin store, and the store's builds for other platforms (installed from archives, or
added with `plugins.addBuild`). Only CLAP plugins go in: LV2 plugins are installed on each device (many need libraries
outside their bundles), so an LV2 plugin, like one not on this device, is left out, and
the export says which.

## Reading one

An archive is untrusted. Reading extracts it into a new folder of its own, refusing, and leaving
nothing behind:

- an entry outside `library.json`, `Performances/`, `Sounds/`, `Assets/` and `Plugins/`;
- a path that is absolute, climbs out (`..`), names a drive (`:`), uses a backslash, is hidden
  (a component starting with `.`), has a control character, or is longer than 1024 bytes;
- a link, or an entry twice;
- more than 65536 entries, more than 8 GiB in all, or an entry over 2 GiB, as declared; and a
  file that extracts to another size than it declares;
- a manifest that is not version 2, or names an item whose folder or document is not there, or
  whose document's ID is not the one listed, or a plugin build not under `Plugins/` or not there;
- a file whose SHA-256 is not the one `files` lists, a file `files` does not list or one it
  lists that is not there, and a plugin build whose digest is not its own.

Hashes say an archive is whole and as it was made, not who made it: signatures are planned
(RFC 0006).

## Installing one

- **As a library:** locked, in `Libraries/<id>/` in the data folder with its manifest. Items
  keep their IDs. Installing again copies only the items that are missing. Uninstalling removes
  the folder; deleting an item removes its folder, and installing again brings it back.
- **Into the user's own storage:** each item is copied into `Performances/` or `Sounds/` under a
  new ID and a new revision, its info's `origin` recording the archive's ID, the item's ID there
  and the copy's content hash. A Performance's parts that came from a Sound in the archive point
  at that Sound's copy. Installing again skips an item whose copy is still there with that hash;
  one edited or deleted since is copied again.
- **All of it or chosen items.**
- **Samples** go into the user's sample library (RFC 0009) by their hash either way, so they stay
  when a library is uninstalled. A sample an item needs that is in neither the archive nor the
  device is reported.
- **Plugins:** every build of each plugin the installed items use goes into the plugin store,
  each whole or not at all, so this device can pass the others on in its own exports (a desktop
  carrying a device's builds). A Performance whose plugin is not at its `pathHint` finds this
  device's build there. A build already there with the same digest is left; a different one is
  kept and reported; a plugin with no build for this device is reported.

## The plugin store

`Plugins/<format>/<id>@<version>/` in the data folder (characters other than letters, digits,
`.`, `-`, `@` and `_` made `_`) holds `plugin.json`, `{format, id, version, name}`, as the folder
name cannot say them exactly, and a folder per platform with its build: `macos-arm64/Odin2.clap`.
`plugins.list` shows each plugin with the library items that use it; removing one is refused
while the open Performance plays it, and what used it opens with a stand-in until it is back.

Two items with one ID are listed once, the user's own first: so a Performance exported and
installed as a library on the device it came from shows the original, not the locked copy.
Installed into the user's own storage (the default for an export) it is a new copy.

Not yet: a Sound from a locked library exported as that library's item, signatures,
and grouped cleanup of plugins nothing uses (RFC 0006).
